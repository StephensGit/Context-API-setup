## Overview

This project uses the Therapie private API key that was shared with me for the purpose of this assignment. The application allows users to select from a range of services in multiple Therapie clinics between two dates. It's built with a mobile first approach, re-sizing accordingly for all devices.

### Built with

- React
- Hooks
- React Context


## Run Locally

Go to the project directory

```bash
  cd my-project
```

Install dependencies

```bash
  npm install
```

Start the server

```bash
  npm run start
```

## NB

Please note, if the link I provided hosting the live version of this site doesn't display any clincis, services or results, the API limit has been reached and needs to be reset.
